/// per-server counter and keying on it alone silently aliases two servers'
/// sections onto each other.

    /// - A pinned entry whose section no longer exists, or whose server is not
    ///   connected, is skipped — but it is still preserved on write.
    /// - Duplicate pins for one section: the first one wins.
    /// - `isHidden` entries are *not* pinned to the front: a hidden library falls
    ///   through to the tail block. This is the full order, hidden libraries
    ///   included — the settings editor and Home's hub grouping need every
    ///   section. Screens that list libraries drop the ones in
